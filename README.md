# Machine Learning Project

> 1. Choose a public dataset that you can train a deep learning model on.
> 2. Create 1+ model(s) in pytorch that is based on/a combination of MLP, LSTM, ConvNet, Transformer.
>
> 3. Train it, evaluate, analyze and if possible iterate this process a few times.

# Instructions

- **_Deadline_** = 15 Decembre 2023
- Write a report in French in markdown (or pure text format), with links to figures/curves
- A code in python + pytorch

# Criteria used for grades:

- Quality and depth of your analysis
- Balanced contribution in the group (through GIT history)
- Work progress over time (through GIT history)
- The **report** is by far the most important! Between **5 and 15 “pages”**

# Ideas

- Créer un _Détecteur de spam pour Email_
- Reconnaissance de panneaux de signalisation
